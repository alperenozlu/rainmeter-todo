# ‚úîÔ∏è Rainmeter To-Do

While searching for a Rainmeter todo skin for my personal needs, I found a skin named [rainmeter-todo-list](https://github.com/Pernickety/rainmeter-todo-list). This project has been developed based on [rainmeter-todo-list](https://github.com/Pernickety/rainmeter-todo-list).  I developed this code with various performance fixes and features (delete, order, trash etc...).

## ü§ñ Technical Details & Notes

### üóíÔ∏è Tasks and Editing Tasks Manually

In an emergency, you may want to edit the task file manually. For this, you must first know the structure of the task file.

- In the first line of the `tasks.txt` file, there is `task|x|x` information. This line should never be deleted. The program accepts this line as the title.

- Each line in the file is a task.

- Task's information is separated by  `|` character. The attribute belonging to a column is shown in the table below.  

| 1         | 2            | 3            | 4            |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Task Text | Is Completed | Is Recurring | Is Important |

For example, a completed and important task would look like this `task title|x||x` 
    
If it's just a completed task, it's look like `task title|x||` 

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Sync With Multiple Device

Added and deleted tasks are stored on a file basis. Since there is no database connection, you can use programs such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive to synchronize between multiple devices.

- Go to `rainmeter-todo` folder in your Rainmeter skins location
- Start the sync process for the `todo` folder through the cloud program you use.

### Notes

- You can contact me on GitHub or Deviantart for your ideas and comments.
- Recurring tasks cannot be deleted. It's a feature I added to prevent the content of this recurring task from being deleted. 

### üòî Known Bugs and Issues
- Encoding problems.
- If Windows commands are entered as a task, the relevant command is triggered.
- If the task contains the `'` character, it's not saved.

PS: I continue to work on the errors I mentioned above, not in a short time, but I will try to solve them one day üòÇ.
